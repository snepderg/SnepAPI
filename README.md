# Snow Leopard Image API (SnepAPI)

This project is an API that retrieves images of snow leopards. It's currently in the early stages of development.

## Current Functionality

As of now, the API fetches images from a local directory.

## Future Plans

The goal is to expand this into a REST API, and create a frontend similar to [RandomFox](https://randomfox.ca).

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
